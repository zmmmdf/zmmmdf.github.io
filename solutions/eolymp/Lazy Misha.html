                <p style="font-size:25px ;  text-align: justify"> ( The original statement can be found <a href="https://www.eolymp.com/en/problems/3867" target="_blank">here</a> )Misha wants to play football with guys and was about to leave the house, but he was caught by mom, who told him that if he won't help her in the house, he will not go to the football. Mom suggested that Misha do one of three things: either wash the dishes, vacuum the apartment, or play with his younger sister Marina, while the mother goes to the store. Misha wondered how long it takes for each case:
It is obvious that Misha will choose the work that takes the least time. Your program must give the time during which Misha will perform the mother's job.</p>
